                  AgentRef references an Agent for this task.
                  If not specified, uses the "default" Agent in the same namespace.

              contexts:

                  Contexts references Context CRDs to include in this task.
                  Each ContextMount specifies which Context to use and where to mount it.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. Agent.contexts (Agent-level defaults)
                    2. Task.contexts (Task-specific contexts)
                    3. Task.description (highest, becomes ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md)
                items:
                  description: |-
                    ContextMount references a Context resource and specifies how to mount it.
                    This allows the same Context to be mounted at different paths by different Tasks.
                  properties:
                    mountPath:
                      description: |-
                        MountPath specifies where this context should be mounted in the agent pod.
                        If specified, the context content is written to this file path.
                        Example: "${WORKSPACE_DIR}/guides/coding-standards.md"

                        If NOT specified (empty), the context content is appended to ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md
                        (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace")
                        in a structured XML format:
                          <context name="coding-standards" namespace="default" type="File">
                          ... content ...
                          </context>

                        This allows multiple contexts to be aggregated into a single task.md file,
                        which the agent can parse and understand.

                  Description is the task instruction/prompt.
                  The controller creates ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md with this content
                  (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace").
                  This is the primary way to tell the agent what to do.
