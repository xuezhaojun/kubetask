          CronTask represents a scheduled task that runs on a cron schedule.
          CronTask creates Task resources at scheduled times, similar to how
          Kubernetes CronJob creates Jobs.

                          Context priority (lowest to highest):
                            1. Agent.contexts (Agent-level defaults)

                            ContextMount references a Context resource and specifies how to mount it.
                            This allows the same Context to be mounted at different paths by different Tasks.
                          properties:

                                MountPath specifies where this context should be mounted in the agent pod.
                                If specified, the context content is written to this file path.
                                Example: "${WORKSPACE_DIR}/guides/coding-standards.md"

                                If NOT specified (empty), the context content is appended to ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md
                                (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace")
                                in a structured XML format:
                                  <context name="coding-standards" namespace="default" type="File">
                                  ... content ...
                                  </context>

                                This allows multiple contexts to be aggregated into a single task.md file,
                                which the agent can parse and understand.
