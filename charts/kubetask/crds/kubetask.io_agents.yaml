                  When humanInTheLoop is enabled on a Task, the command will be wrapped to:

                    ContextMount references a Context resource and specifies how to mount it.
                    This allows the same Context to be mounted at different paths by different Tasks.
                  properties:

                      description: |-
                        MountPath specifies where this context should be mounted in the agent pod.
                        If specified, the context content is written to this file path.
                        Example: "${WORKSPACE_DIR}/guides/coding-standards.md"

                        (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace")
                        in a structured XML format:

                      Labels defines additional labels to add to the agent pod.
                      These labels are applied to the Job's pod template and enable integration with:
                        - NetworkPolicy podSelector for network isolation
                        - Service selector for service discovery
                        - PodMonitor/ServiceMonitor for Prometheus monitoring
                        - Any other label-based pod selection

                      Example: To make pods match a NetworkPolicy with podSelector:
                        labels:
                          network-policy: agent-restricted

                      RuntimeClassName specifies the RuntimeClass to use for agent pods.
                      RuntimeClass provides a way to select container runtime configurations
                      such as gVisor (runsc) or Kata Containers for enhanced isolation.

                      This is useful when running untrusted AI agent code that may generate
                      and execute arbitrary commands. Using gVisor or Kata provides an
                      additional layer of security beyond standard container isolation.

                      The RuntimeClass must exist in the cluster before use.
                      Common values: "gvisor", "kata", "runc" (default if not specified)

                      Example:
                        runtimeClassName: gvisor

                          This enables advanced scheduling based on node attributes, pod co-location,
                          or pod anti-affinity for high availability.

                                        MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
