                  Credentials defines secrets that should be available to the agent.
                  Similar to GitHub Actions secrets, these can be mounted as files or
                  exposed as environment variables.

                  Example use cases:
                    - GitHub token for repository access (env: GITHUB_TOKEN)
                    - SSH keys for git operations (file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa)

                    Credential represents a secret that should be available to the agent.

                        If specified, the secret key's value is set as this environment variable.

                        Defaults to 0600 (read/write for owner only) for security.
                        Use 0400 for read-only files like SSH keys.

                  meaning Batch commonContext and variableContexts take precedence.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. WorkspaceConfig.defaultContexts (base layer)
                    2. Batch.commonContext (shared across all tasks in the batch)
                    3. Batch.variableContexts[i] (task-specific contexts)

                  Use this for organization-wide defaults like coding standards, security policies,
                  or common tool configurations that should apply to all tasks.

                                    The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.

                  ServiceAccountName specifies the Kubernetes ServiceAccount to use for agent pods.

                  The ServiceAccount must exist in the same namespace where tasks are created.
                  Users are responsible for creating the ServiceAccount and appropriate RBAC bindings.

                  The Helm chart provides a ClusterRole "kubetask-agent" with minimal permissions
                  (read secrets and configmaps) that can be bound to your ServiceAccount.

                  Example setup in your namespace:

                  The tools image must follow the standard directory structure:

                  When specified, the controller creates an initContainer that copies
                  /tools from this image to a shared volume, making the tools available
                  to the agent container via PATH environment variable.

                  This enables decoupling of agent and tools - each can be built and
                  versioned independently, and combined at runtime.
