          Context represents a reusable context resource for AI agent tasks.
          Context is the top-level API for managing reusable context content that can be
          shared across multiple Tasks and Agents.

          Unlike inline contexts (ContextItem), Context CRs enable:
            - Reusability: Share the same context across multiple Tasks
            - Independent lifecycle: Update context without modifying Tasks
            - Version control: Track context changes in Git
            - Separation of concerns: Context content vs. mount location

          The mount path is NOT defined in Context - it's specified by the referencing
          Task or Agent via ContextMount.mountPath. This allows the same Context to be
          mounted at different paths by different consumers.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                      Key specifies a single key to mount as a file.
                      If not specified, all keys are mounted as files in the directory.

                      Depth specifies the clone depth for shallow cloning.
                      1 means shallow clone (fastest), 0 means full clone.
                      Defaults to 1 for efficiency.

                      Path is the path within the repository to mount.
                      Can be a file or directory. If empty, the entire repository is mounted.

                      Note on .git directory:
                        - If Path is empty (entire repo): The mounted directory WILL contain .git/
                        - If Path is specified (subdirectory): The mounted directory will NOT contain .git/

                      If not specified, anonymous clone is attempted.
